# takeNote
A simple note taking application

## Description: 
In this project, I modified starter code to create an application called takeNote which can be used to take and save notes. This application used Express.js back end and will save and retreive note data from a JSON database file. I have left some comments to help any future developers (or myself) remember what the code is doing throughout.
